''' PPMI functions. '''

# ppmi = Positive Point-wise Mutual Information.
#         This is the same as PMI, but with negative values replaced with zero.
#         PMI measures the likelihood of a word being associated with another
#         word (collocations?)
#         This isn't an alternative to tf-idf, but instead of values the
#         'relatedness' of two words.
